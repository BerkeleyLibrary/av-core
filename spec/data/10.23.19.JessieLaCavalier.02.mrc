Jesse LeCavalier (LECAVALIER R+D) explores the architectural and urban implications of contemporary logistics and infrastructure. He is the author of The Rule of Logistics: Walmart and the Architecture of Fulfillment (University of Minnesota Press, 2016) and associate professor of architecture at the Daniels Faculty of Architecture at the University of Toronto. LeCavalier was the Daniel Rose Visiting Assistant Professor at the Yale School of Architecture from 2018-19 and the 2010–11 Sanders Fellow at the University of Michigan. His work has appeared in Cabinet, Public Culture, Places, Art Papers, and Harvard Design Magazine and his essay, “The Restlessness of Objects,” was the recipient of a 2013 Core77 Design Award. LeCavalier’s installation “Architectures of Fulfillment” was part of the 2017 Seoul Biennale for Architecture and Urbanism as his project "Shelf Life" was one of five finalists for the 2018 MoMA PS1 Young Architects Program.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.2 aUniversity of California, Berkeley.bColl. of Environ.
